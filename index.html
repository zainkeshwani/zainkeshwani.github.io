                    As you've probably already read, I am Zain Keshwani. In the tabs of the actual
                    website, you can see a lot of the professional information about me, however,
                    here I will tell you more about me as a person and how I got to where I am now.
                    I have a
                    dog named Climber who is a Great Pyrenees-English Bulldog mix. I live in Dallas,
                    Texas, and am an asipring software
                    engineer.

                    <br>
                    Ever since I can remember, I've been interested in computers. I have always been
                    interested in programming, and I have always been fascinated by how computers
                    work, especially behind the scenes in the code. As a result of such, I got into
                    computer programming in the 7th grade, the grade in which COVID-19 struck the
                    world and forced us to stay home.
                    <br><br>
                    This sudden abundance of free time that I had
                    made me want to do something productive throughout the day, which led me to
                    stumbling onto W3 Schools' website and learning Python. From there, I started
                    taking classes in high school and doing projects on the side to quench my thirst
                    for coding.
                    <br><br>
                    After taking my very first computer science course, I learned Java
                    and started learning more HTML/CSS, which led to me making this website during
                    the winter break of my 10th grade year.
                    <br><br>
                    Had I not stumbled across W3's page
                    about coding, I might have never embraced my love for programming and computers,
                    and never would have made it to where I am now. Thanks W3 Schools!

    <!-- SECTION ABOUT PROJECTS -->
    <h1 id="sub-heading-left">PROJECTS</h1>
    <ul id="exp-tab-words">
      <li><strong>Making this website</strong>: as you may have read on the welcome page, this website was
        made to showcase who I am and what I have done coded from scratch in HTML/CSS/JS</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Vector Calculator + Visualizer </strong> coded in Java and JavaFX. In my AP Physics class, there were
        a lot of vector calculations that needed to be done in order to get to a final answer. As a result of this, I
        made this calculator to help me in doing so. This calculator can do basic operations such as addition and
        subtraction, but also can find dot and cross products, the angle between two vectors, and much more. After
        performing these calculations, though, the visualizer allows you to draw the two vectors as well as the
        resultant to make it easier to see the operation's results.</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Amazon Web Scraper</strong> in Python using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. This was something I did to
        make it quicker and easier to search for items on Amazon.com without having to actually open the website and
        look through all the search results. The program will take in an item name (what you are searching for), a
        maximum price you are willing to pay, as well as the number of results you wish to see and scrape the site to
        retrieve these items. It then will add the item you choose to the cart with a quantity and then open Amazon.com
        and show you your cart.</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Matrix Calculator</strong> coded in Java. When I was creating my Vector Calculator (see above), I
        realized that more often than not, vectors are represented as matrices. This gave me the idea to create a
        calculator for matrices as well. The calculator supports a vast range of operations, from simple things such as
        addition or scalar multiplication, as well as more complex things like finding transposes, adjoints, and much
        more. In said program, I also made my own exceptions for times where calculations could not be performed due to
        preconditions (ex: adding two matrices of different orders or finding the inverse of matrices that have a
        determinant of zero).</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Triangle Solver</strong> coded in Java. This program will take in a triangle based on input (ex:
        base and height, three sides, etc.) and output as much information as it can about the triangle. The program
        also has a subclass specifically for right triangles, as oftentimes there are different procedures used for
        them. This was
        something I found useful in class when, given limited information about a triangle, we were required to list
        as much as we could about the triangle based on the given info. In said program, I also made my own exceptions
        for times where calculations could not be performed due to preconditions (ex: trying to create triangles that
        cannot exist or attempting to create triangles with negative angles or side lengths).</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Rational Function Information Finder</strong> coded in Java. I took AP Pre-Calculus in the 10th
        grade, where
        we learned all about rational functions in math. As such, I thought it would be a good idea to make a program
        that can simply give you all the information about the rational function. For example, my program will tell
        you the x and y intercepts of the function, simplify the rational and find all of its discontinuities (holes
        and vertical asymptotes), and much much more. All in all, this useful program helped me double check my work
        more often than not and also was a good way to practice applying my knowledge of Java to something useful in
        my everyday life.</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Sentence and Word Check Project</strong> coded in Python to check if individual words are
        in the dictionary, as well as check if sentences have proper grammar (capitalization,
        punctuation, all words are spelled correctly, and more). The program, being linked to a free
        dictionary API online, can produce synonyms and antonyms for words that you input to it.</li>
      <p><br></p>
      <li><strong>Magic 8 Ball</strong> coded in Java. Originally starting as a quick and easy side project to kill
        time, this actually evolved into a full scale project. I was introduced to JFrame as a result of this and was
        also able to have some fun by asking the 8 Ball random questions during testing!</li>
